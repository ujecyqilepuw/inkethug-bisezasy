Overview
LIMITED FIRST PRINT EDITIONâ€•featuring spray-painted edges, while supplies last.

Once Upon a Time meets The Office in Hannah Maehrerâ€™s laugh-out-loud viral TikTok series turned novel, about the sunshine assistant to an Evil Villainâ€¦and their unexpected romance.

ASSISTANT WANTED: Notorious, high-ranking villain seeks loyal, levelheaded assistant for unspecified office duties, supporting staff for random mayhem, terror, and other Dark Things In General. Discretion a must. Excellent benefits.

 With ailing family to support, Evie Sage&#039;s employment status isn&#039;t just important, it&#039;s vital. So when a mishap with Rennedawnâ€™s most infamous Villain results in a job offerâ€”naturally, she says yes. No job is perfect, of course, but even less so when you develop a teeny crush on your terrifying, temperamental, and undeniably hot boss. Donâ€™t find evil so attractive, Evie.

 But just when sheâ€™s getting used to severed heads suspended from the ceiling and the odd squish of an errant eyeball beneath her heel, Evie suspects this dungeon has a huge ratâ€¦and not just the literal kind. Because something rotten is growing in the kingdom of Rennedawn, and someone wants to take the Villainâ€”and his entire nefarious empireâ€”out.

 Now Evie must not only resist drooling over her boss but also figure out exactly who is sabotaging his workâ€¦and ensure he makes them pay.

 After all, a good job is hard to find.
