Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Drawing heavily from the historicity of the Spanish Golden Age, Leigh Bardugo delivers a captivating historical fantasy in a way that only she could. True to the era it takes place, The Familiar blurs the lines between magic, science and fraud, making for a riveting read thatâ€™s perfect for fans of historical fiction and fans of Bardugo alike. From the New York Times bestselling author of Ninth House, Hell Bent, and creator of the Grishaverse series comes a highly anticipated historical fantasy set during the Spanish Golden Age

 In a shabby house, on a shabby street, in the new capital of Madrid, Luzia Cotado uses scraps of magic to get through her days of endless toil as a scullion. But when her scheming mistress discovers the lump of a servant cowering in the kitchen is actually hiding a talent for little miracles, she demands Luzia use those gifts to better the family&#039;s social position.
 
 What begins as simple amusement for the bored nobility takes a perilous turn when Luzia garners the notice of Antonio PÃ©rez, the disgraced secretary to Spain&#039;s king. Still reeling from the defeat of his armada, the king is desperate for any advantage in the war against England&#039;s heretic queenâ€”and PÃ©rez will stop at nothing to regain the king&#039;s favor.
 
 Determined to seize this one chance to better her fortunes, Luzia plunges into a world of seers and alchemists, holy men and hucksters, where the lines between magic, science, and fraud are never certain. But as her notoriety grows, so does the danger that her Jewish blood will doom her to the Inquisition&#039;s wrath. She will have to use every bit of her wit and will to surviveâ€”even if that means enlisting the help of GuillÃ©n Santangel, an embittered immortal familiar whose own secrets could prove deadly for them both.
