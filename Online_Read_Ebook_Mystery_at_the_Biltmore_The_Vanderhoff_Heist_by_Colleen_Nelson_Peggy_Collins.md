Overview
The Biltmore in New York City is full of mysteries, and Elodie LaRue, a novice detective, plans to piece together the clues and solve the case of the missing jewels. Left behind by her globe-trotting detective parents once again, Elodie decides to prove sheâ€™s worthy of joining them on a case by setting up her own detective agency at her renowned Upper West Side home, The Biltmore. When a pair of sapphire and diamond earrings mysteriously disappear from Mrs. Vanderhoffâ€™s apartment, Elodie is asked to solve the case. Elodie begins her investigation the way any good detective would, looking for clues and potential suspects. With twists, turns, and suspects galore, will Elodie be able to prove she has what it takes to solve a crime? Or will the LaRue Detective Agency fail on its first case? As Elodie, her dog Carnegie, and new friend Oscar (a self-proclaimed parkour master) delve deeper into the mystery, they encounter a quirky cast of characters, an array of clues, and a little bit of fun. Colored vignettes by award-winning artist, Peggy Collins, are scattered throughout the story, bringing additional humor to the cast of quirky characters. From the award-winning author of The Umbrella House, Colleen Nelson brings another New York apartment building to life in Mystery at the Biltmore. Written with charm and wit, Mystery at The Biltmore is Only Murders in the Building meets Harriet the Spy.
