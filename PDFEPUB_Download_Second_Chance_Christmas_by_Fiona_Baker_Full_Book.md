A heartwarming holiday romance with small town charm and Christmas cheer, perfect for reading by the fireside as you curl up under a cozy blanket.

 Shelley Keegan is an ex-Olympic figure skater whose past has haunted her ever since the entire world saw her take a bad fall during a televised skating routine. Her fall cost the USA the gold medal, and she hasn&amp;#039;t been able to get back on the ice since then. As she struggles to find her passion again, she arrives in Snowy Pine Ridge looking for some solace and cheer during the Christmas season. Hoping to avoid awkward questions or gossip, she decides not to tell anyone in the quaint little town who she is-but her hope of remaining anonymous gets more complicated when she meets single father Matthew Martinez and his son Brandon. The holidays are a tough time to be a single parent, and Matthew is determined to honor his late wife by giving Brandon a Christmas to remember. So even though he initially butts heads with the petite woman he meets at the local ice rink, he soon realizes that she might be able to help Brandon with the one thing he loves most: skating. Can Shelley let go of the ghosts of her past and rediscover her love for the ice? And can Matthew open up his heart to the possibility of falling for someone new? One thing is for certain. With snow swirling in the air and the holiday spirit all around, there&amp;#039;s no better time than Christmas for second chances.
