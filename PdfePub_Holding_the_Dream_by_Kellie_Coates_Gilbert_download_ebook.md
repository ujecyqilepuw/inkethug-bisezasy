Overview
Sometimes, the most profound victories involve risking the heart. Lila Bellamy is a strong-willed single mother who aims to become a large animal veterinarian while juggling the demands of raising her teenage daughter. Despite her ambition and quiet determination, her aspirations are often thwarted by her boss, Doc Tillman, a seasoned yet stubborn veterinarian, who underestimates her skills and challenges her at every turn. When health issues necessitate Doc Tillman&#039;s temporary departure, a chance opens for Lila to step up and show her skills, hopefully winning her boss over. That is until the charismatic and frustratingly enigmatic Whit Calloway shows up at her clinic, hired by Doc Tillman to take over in his absence. Sparks fly from the get-go between Lila and Whit, transforming their professional rivalry into a fiery connection that neither of them can ignore. As they navigate their competing ambitions and burgeoning feelings, they&#039;ll learn that the heart, much like their furry patients, requires tender care and can heal in the most unexpected ways.
